Gretel is an app based on the Exquisite Corpse story game, in which a story is collectively assembled by a group of people, each of whom adds a composition in sequence without seeing what came before. When completed, the story is a fun-to-read jumble of different ideas and styles.

In Gretel, a user can access the app on desktop or Android mobile and view nearby stories on a map or in list form, create a new story in a specific location, add to an incomplete story if in range, or view completed stories around the world.
