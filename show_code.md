#Show Code

- not sure if we need to do this in this presentation or not ...
- if we do, a snippet of code from server, mobile, desktop, CSS, with someone who worked on it talking about each?
- embedded in slide so we don't have to move in and out (screenshots - eg. original code VS refactored code?)
