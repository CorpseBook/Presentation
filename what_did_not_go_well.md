#What did not go well

- project was bigger than we realised with more small moving parts than we initially thought of/accounted for
- overall understanding of the flow of the app
- time management
- waffle wasn't used by everyone
- more of a challenge than something that didn't go well: keeping everyone busy/meeting their learning objectives
- adding stretches
